here's an idea that I have been thinking about: "why do open source software developers spend their time building valuable tools and give them away for free in the end?" 

There is some theoretical work on this question - by a certain Jean Tirole - but the empirical side of this has remained largely elusive to economists. "no data" is what you hear. It's often difficult to even find out the identity of those open source developers, let alone their demographics or labor market situation. This is a shame, because open source projects are maturing in many domains, often completely annihilating commercial efforts. (For example, this email reached you via a series of web servers that where built on top of the free unix kernel given away for free by a Finish grad student called Linus Torvalds. The server is called Apache.)

proposition for a nerdy student:

* take a closer look at the stack overflow surveys. in particular the latest wave. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017
* given it's open source, we can observe all open source related activity of a developer on github (or similar). one could infer who contributes how much. 
* One would need to find out more about those people via their user profile
* for nerds only (or people who want to become nerds)
* This is clearly only a rough sketch of an idea, but maybe it gets you thinking if you are interested.
* I have got a list of potentially useful references. anyone interested stop by.
