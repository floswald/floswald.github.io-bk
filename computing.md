You can find all of my publicly assessible software on my [github profile](https://github.com/floswald).

I have written software in high-level languages like Matlab, python, R and [julia](https://julialang.org). I am an expert R and julia user, I've good python skills, Matlab is somewhat outdated. I am well-versed with C++ and fortran. I am using PostgreSQL + postgis databases (interfaced from either R or python) to manage large scale geo-spatial datasets.

I have used the phantastic [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org) (R + C++) package in several projects. I have been using Julia for computationally intensive projects starting in 2014 for my job market paper, and I have never looked back.

### WiFi speed in my office

I have been collecting measurements of wifi speed in my office for a while now. This graph gets updated every day:

## Setup

Real pro's get invited to share their setup at [`usesthis.com`](https://usesthis.com/interviews/hadley.wickham/). Just for the fun of it (maybe remotely useful to a student?), I give you here...
