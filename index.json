The model is estimated using micro data on credit reports and mortgages combined with individual level data from the American Community Survey.

Using the model I estimate the value of the migration option and the welfare impact of policies that may restrict mobility. The value of the option to move ranges from 0% up to almost 10% of lifetime consumption depending on the type of household considered. While I obtain an estimate of the elasticity of local population size with respect to a large regional shock which is close to estimates from the previous literature, I am able to show that the respective elasticities of outflows for renters and owners from that region are orders of magnitude apart. This has important implications for the design of housing and labour market policies.

In this paper we test the effect of the law change on mortgage supply and demand in addition to mortgage default. Using unique mortgage loan level application and performance data, we find strong evidence that lenders tightened their lending standards in response to the law change. Particularly, lenders reduced approval rates and loan sizes for affected mortgages by about 5 percent. Households, by contrast, did not increase their mortgage applications because of the law change. More importantly, the law change did not appear to have affected mortgage default and house foreclosure outcomes. These results thus cast a cautionary note on the effectiveness of policy recommendations that intend to use deficiency laws to curb mortgage defaults.","tags":null,"title":"Recourse and residential mortgages: The case of Nevada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lars Nesheim","Jonathan Halket","Florian Oswald"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"7d3b33090189e93797f6f09e576bc5f4","permalink":"https://floswald.github.io/publication/housing-stock/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/housing-stock/","section":"publication","summary":"Using the English Housing Survey, we estimate a supply side selection model of the allocation of properties to the owner-occupied and rental sectors.
