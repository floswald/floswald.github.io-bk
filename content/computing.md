You can find all of my publicly assessible software on my [github profile](https://github.com/floswald).

I have written software in high-level languages like Matlab, python, `R` and [`julia`](https://julialang.org). I am an expert `R` and `julia` user, I've good python skills, Matlab is somewhat outdated. I am well-versed with `C++` and `fortran`. I am using PostgreSQL + postgis databases (interfaced from either R or python) to manage large scale geo-spatial datasets.

I have used the phantastic [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org) (`R` + `C++`) package in several projects. I have been using Julia for computationally intensive projects starting in 2014 for my job market paper, and I have never looked back.
