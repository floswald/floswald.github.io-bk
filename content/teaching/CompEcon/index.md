This is a graduate level course in Computational Economics. We cover a series of widely used computational techniques both in theory and in practice. The course relies on the [julia](https://julialang.org) language for technical computing, and we use online material from [quantecon](https://quantecon.org) extensively. Additional to this excellent material, the main value added from the course are the homeworks, which come with fully worked solutions.

## Materials

* The course syllabus is [available on github](https://github.com/ScPo-CompEcon/Syllabus).
* Students should look at the [CoursePack website](https://scpo-compecon.github.io/CoursePack/).
* All material, including homeworks, are collected under our [github org](https://github.com/ScPo-CompEcon).
